This repository contains a template for blueprint-driven formalization projects in Lean 4.

## Install Lean 4

Ensure that you have a functioning Lean 4 installation. If you do not, please follow
the [Lean installation guide](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html).

## Use this Template

To create a new repository using this template, ensure you are on the correct repository page
([LeanProject](https://github.com/pitmonticone/LeanProject)) and then follow these steps:

1. Click the **Use this template** button located at the top right of the repository page.
2. Click the **Create a new repository** button.
3. Select the account or organization where you want to create it, choose a name for the new
repository, and click the **Create repository** button.

## Clone this Repository

To clone this repository to your local machine, please refer to the relevant section of the
GitHub documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

## Customize this Template

To tailor this template to your specific project, follow these steps:

1. If you don't have a Python environment, you can install one by following the instructions in the
[Python installation guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
1. Verify your Python installation by running:
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```
1. Verify your Pip installation by running:
    ```bash
    pip3 --version
    ```
1. Ensure your terminal is in the project directory by running the following command:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```
1.	Execute the customization script by running:
    ```bash
    scripts/customize_template.py NewProject
    ```
    where `NewProject` must be replaced by the name of your project.

The script [`customize_template.py`](scripts/customize_template.py) will automatically rename the
project folder and update the necessary files and configurations to match the new project name.

## Configure GitHub Pages

To set up GitHub Pages for your repository, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Settings** tab of your repository.
2. In the left sidebar, click on the **Pages** section.
3. In the **Source** dropdown, select `GitHub Actions`.

## Repository Layout

The template repository is organized as follows (listing the main folders and files):

- [`.github`](.github) contains GitHub-specific configuration files and workflows.
    - [`workflows`](.github/workflows) contains GitHub Actions workflow files.
        - [`build-project.yml`](.github/workflows/build-project.yml) defines the workflow for building
        the Lean project on pushes, pull requests, and manual triggers. This is a minimalistic build
        workflow which is not necessary if you decide to generate a blueprint (see instructions below)
        and can be manually disabled by clicking on the **Actions** tab, selecting **Build Project**
        in the left sidebar, then clicking the horizontal triple dots (â‹¯) on the right,
        and choosing **Disable workflow**.
        - [`create-release.yml`](.github/workflows/create-release.yml): defines the workflow for creating a new Git tag and GitHub release when the `lean-toolchain` file is updated in the `main` branch. Ensure the following settings are configured under **Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions**: "Read and write permissions" and "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests".
        - [`update-dependencies.yml`](.github/workflows/update-dependencies.yml) is the dependency
        update workflow to be triggered manually by default. [It's not documented yet, but it will be soon.]
    - [`dependabot.yml`](.github/dependabot.yml) is the configuration file to automate CI dependency updates.
- [`.vscode`](.vscode) contains Visual Studio Code configuration files
    - [`extensions.json`](.vscode/extensions.json) recommends VS Code extensions for the project.
    - [`settings.json`](.vscode/settings.json) defines the project-specific settings for VS Code.
- [`Project`](Project) should contain the Lean code files.
    - [`Mathlib`](Project/Mathlib) should contain `.lean` files with declarations missing from
    existing Mathlib developments.
    - [`ForMathlib`](Project/ForMathlib) should contain `.lean` files with new declarations to
    be upstreamed to Mathlib.
    - [`Example.lean`](Project/Example.lean) is a sample Lean file.
- [`scripts`](scripts) contains scripts to update Mathlib ensuring that the latest version is
fetched and integrated into the development environment.
- [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) specifies files and folders to be ignored by Git.
and environment.
- [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) should contain the code of conduct for the project.
- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) should provide the guidelines for contributing to the
project.
- [`lakefile.toml`](lakefile.toml) is the configuration file for the Lake build system used in
Lean projects.
- [`lean-toolchain`](lean-toolchain) specifies the Lean version and toolchain used for the project.

affirmatively with `y` to the following prompt:

```console
Do you want to create a home page for the project, with links to the blueprint, the API documentation and the repository? [y/n]:
